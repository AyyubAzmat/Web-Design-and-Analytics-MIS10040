<h3>Top 3 Albums</h3>

<ol id="albums">
<li>Is This It</li>
<p>Their first album which was released in 2001 took the world by storm. They were hailed the saviours of rock n roll.
This 36 minute album can be claimed almost flawless. Each of the 10 songs serve a purpose and fuse together for a seamless
rock album. One with no fillers and B-side material. Julian's angst fueled lyrics and raspy voice are accompanied perfectly 
by great drumming, catchy riffs and thumping baselines. You'll have played the album 10 times over without realising, and
when you do you'll continue to keep playing it because it's that good.

Best Track: The Modern Age
Underrated Gem: Is This It
</p>
<li>Room on Fire</li>
<p>
Often critisised for being too similar to the previous album, Is This It. While some songs are similar that could be
attributed to the fact that they probably had a lot of left over material after recording Is This It. The album shows 
a more confident band who have increased their lyrical and musical abilities. The album received mixed reviews but 
birthed The Strokes best song in my opinion.
Best Track: Reptilia
Underrated Gem: What Ever Happened
</p>
<li>Angles</li>
<p>
Angles was different from the previous two albums in the sense that the band took a different approach to making the music
and the lyrics. The topics of the lyrics was mostly denial and they were quite nonchalant. They made use of synths and the
sound was definitely different from their previous albums. While some songs weren't up to the mark over all the album has a
fresh and new sound and there are some songs in there that hark back to The Strokes' early days. 
Best Track: Machu Picchu/Under Cover of Darkness
Underrated Gem: Life is Simple in the Moonlight
